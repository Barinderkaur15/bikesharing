In Order to show how successful the model will be, we are using Citi bike new york case analysis, based on the figures and number a tableau interactive dashboard is created. <BR>

For analysis Purposes we are trying  to answere the following questions  

What is Population Of des Moines ? How Does its population compare to the population of new York city and Does Population affect the number of People who will use the bike sharing program?

In This analysis, we have considered the number of rides, average ride time and  bike operation for month of August .<BR>

AS Per Us census, the Population estimate  for July 1, 2018 was 8,398,748. While, the Des Moines  data shows the Population estimate base of 216,853 .That shows the population of New York approx 35 times more then Des Monies , but data aloso reveal that Des Moines population is growing year over year at a rapid pace of 6.2% , which is very important factor for a growing business . <BR>
